# BALDI'S BASICS PLUS: French Translation
This mod of Baldi's Basics Plus changes subtitles, menus and assets in the same way as BB+!*
![Project 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b79c21bb-fded-4eb0-932c-0d9411c768b0)

From posters to soda vending machines, every asset is translated into French, with French equivalent wordplay.

The mod is still up to date! (Mod will be released later than official game release, because I can't have the assets before release.)
